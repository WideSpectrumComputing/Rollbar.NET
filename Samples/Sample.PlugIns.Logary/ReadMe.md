# Sample: Rollbar.NET via Logary

This example demonstrates how to integrate Rollbar.NET within an application that already uses Logary for its logging/tracing purposes 
and have all (or some of) its logs/traces forwarded/reported to the Rollbar API Service/Dashboard.

## Starting Point

In this example, we have a very simple .NET Core console application that already makes use of Logary to log informational and error traces using a Console sink.

## Adding Logs Forwarding to the Rollbar Dashboard



## Done!

Have fun taking advantages for Rollbar Dashboard while monitoring behavior of your products!

Here is an example of an error log from this sample rendered within the Rollbar Dashboard:
